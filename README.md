**Option #7:  PayPal: Case study of removing PayPal Monolith application to microservices-based**

“When PayPal worked with a monolithic architecture, one app did everything. Duplications were common, while teams copy-pasted and tweaked code all the time —and development was like working on an assembly line. Not much was being done. Discuss how Node.js and an all-JavaScript development stack helped PayPal bring efficiencies in engineering and helped rethink and reboot product, design, and operational thinking from a more microservice-based architecture.”

## Why did I select the above topic?
After I read the Professor’s introduction and two given links, I am interested in this topic. Firstly, PayPal is one of big American companies operating the online payments system in the majority of countries. It support online money transfers, and serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods like checks and money orders. Secondly, Node.js became the go-to technology in the past years for both startups and enterprises who decided to embrace microservices. According to the Node Foundation, Node.js is spreading with 3.5 million users and 100% annual growth rate today. Finally, when PayPal tried Node out as the platform of their account overview page, the results of the migration were astounding for PayPal engineering. For instance, the single core Node app was able to handle double rps as the five core Java app. Response time decreased 35 percent, and pages were served 200ms faster. These results are amazing.
